## Magical Predicate Builder 🦄🌈🍀🔮🐇🎩✨🦄🌈🍀🔮🐇🎩✨🦄🌈🍀🔮🐇🎩✨🦄🌈🍀🔮🐇🎩✨🦄

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. The scripts used to build this project and configuration for tests were created by the team that created Create React App. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` from the root folder to install front-end dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run these commands (you can also use `yarn`):

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm deploy`

Deploys the application to GitHub pages

## Architecture

### Frontend

The client for this application is written utilizing `React` and `styled-components`. `styled-components` is a library that allows for styling of React components directly in an es6 environment. The instructions for this project stated to not spend too much time on front-end styling, but since I am being considered for a front-end position I decided to spend a good part of the project on front-end styling. I also decided to make most of the components presentational components, meaning that most of the logic for the client is located in the wrapper `App.js` file. I do not use Redux anywhere in the front-end (only local component state) since the state transformations did not get complex enough to warrant it. The `src/shared` folder contains constants that I use throughout the app.

### Persistance

To save members able to use the app and message state across page refreshes, I decided to use Google's Firebase service. The Firestore database I am using is completely open to the public so there are no API keys in the front-end code. I created a utility to encapsulate some of the Firebase functionality under `src/utils/Firebase.js`. There are two collections in the database: `members` and `chat-rooms`. `chat-rooms` contains docs that follow this structure: `{ name: <chat room name>, messages [{ content: <message content>, fromUser: <user who sent the message>},...]}`.

### Server

The server for this app is a very simple Node backend with one endpoint that utilizes `socket.io` for the socket-based communication. Right now, its only capability is joining rooms and sending messages. The server can be started by running `cd server` and `npm start` or `yarn start`.

### Testing

I have only written unit tests for a couple of functions in the front-end. I wanted to use those tests to demonstrate my knowledge of front-end testing frameworks and mocking node modules and custom modules. The entire application needs more testing including functional tests. That would be my next step in this project.
